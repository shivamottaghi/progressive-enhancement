<!--************ THE STORY ************-->
<article class="story">
    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
        That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
        They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
        This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <em><q>Maybe.</q></em></p>
    <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
        said,
        <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky.
        What a great turn of events.
        You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<em><q>Maybe.</q></em></p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <em><q>Maybe.</q></em></p>
    <p>
        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
        because he had a broken leg.
        Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <em><q>Maybe.</q></em></p>
    <p>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never
        know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune;
        or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.<em><q>Maybe.</q></em></p>

        Conclusion

    <p>
        Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas.
        Let's not make a big deal out of it...
